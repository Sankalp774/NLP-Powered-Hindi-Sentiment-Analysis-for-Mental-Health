Hindi-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Mental-Health

This Python-based application leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze sentiment in Hindi text. By processing user-provided input, the model accurately identifies whether the expressed sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

Key Features:

Hindi Text Analysis: Effectively processes Hindi text to understand underlying emotions and sentiments.
Sentiment Classification: Accurately categorizes text into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
Personalized Stress-Reduction Tips: Offers tailored suggestions for stress relief based on negative sentiment analysis.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive Gradio interface allows users to interact with the model effortlessly.
Customizable: The model can be further trained and improved with additional data.
How it works:

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares Hindi text for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF.
Model Training: Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on a labeled dataset.
Sentiment Prediction: Predicts the sentiment of new input text.
Stress-Reduction Tips: Provides relevant suggestions for stress relief if negative sentiment is detected.
